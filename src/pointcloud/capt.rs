//! This is copied from https://github.com/oh-yes-0-fps/capt/tree/non-nightly
//!
//! This is a Rust implementation of the _collision-affording point tree_ (CAPT), a data structure
//! for SIMD-parallel collision-checking between spheres and point clouds.

//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The core data structure in this library is the [`Capt`], which is a search tree used for
//! collision checking. [`Capt`]s are polymorphic over dimension and data type. On construction,
//! they take in a list of points in a point cloud and a _radius range_: a tuple of the minimum and
//! maximum radius used for querying.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use capt::Capt;
//!
//! // list of points in cloud
//! let points = [[0.0, 1.1], [0.2, 3.1]];
//! let r_min = 0.05;
//! let r_max = 2.0;
//!
//! let capt = Capt::<2>::new(&points, (r_min, r_max), 1);
//! ```
//!
//! Once you have a `Capt`, you can use it for collision-checking against spheres.
//! Correct answers are only guaranteed if you collision-check against spheres with a radius inside
//! the radius range.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use capt::Capt;
//! # let points = [[0.0, 1.1], [0.2, 3.1]];
//! # let capt = Capt::<2>::new(&points, (0.05, 2.0), 1);
//! let center = [0.0, 0.0]; // center of sphere
//! let radius0 = 1.0; // radius of sphere
//! assert!(!capt.collides(&center, radius0));
//!
//! let radius1 = 1.5;
//! assert!(capt.collides(&center, radius1));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Optional features
//!
//! This crate exposes one feature, `simd`, which enables a SIMD-parallel interface for querying
//! `Capt`s. This enables the function `Capt::collides_simd`, a parallel collision checker for
//! batches of 8 f32 search queries using the `wide` crate.
//!
